Hello, I created the code of a discord bot working with the openai api and GPT-3.5. 
You need to have credits in your openai account. To check if you have any, go to https://platform.openai.com/account/usage. 
Please follow the steps in the order below :

1. If you don’t already have it, you will need to install visual studio code. -> https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. If you don’t already have it, you will need to install NodeJs. -> https://nodejs.org/en
3. If you don’t already have it, you will need to create a new bot. -> https://discord.com/developers/applications
4. If you don’t already have it, you will need to create a new openai account. -> https://platform.openai.com/
5. If you don’t already have it, you will need to add credits. If you have create a new account you will have 18 credits. 
Go on https://platform.openai.com/account/usage to see if you have credits. 
If you don't have create a new account or buy credits here -> https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
6. Copy the two code a paste them in your file.
7. In the .env file, just change words in capital letters by your bot token, your api secret key and the channel id where you want to chat with the bot.

If you have a problem with the code, go in my support server (french) -> https://discord.io/Empire-SpaceBot and create a post in #『📚』djs-v14.
